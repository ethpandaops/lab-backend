# Frontend Configuration
# Leave empty to use latest stable release (default)
# Priority: FRONTEND_SOURCE > FRONTEND_BRANCH > latest stable release

# FRONTEND_SOURCE - Copy from local frontend dist/ directory (for development)
FRONTEND_SOURCE=../lab

# FRONTEND_BRANCH - Download latest release matching branch name (release/X → X-v*)
# Examples:
#   FRONTEND_BRANCH=new-changes-abc    (matches release/new-changes-abc → new-changes-abc-v0.0.x)
FRONTEND_BRANCH=frontend #(matches release/frontend → frontend-v0.0.x)
