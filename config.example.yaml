# Bounds service configuration
# Fetches and caches min/max position bounds for incremental CBT tables

# Network configuration (optional overrides and additions)
# Cartographoor provides base networks - use this section to:
# 1. Disable specific cartographoor networks
# 2. Override metadata/URLs for cartographoor networks
# 3. Add custom/local networks not in cartographoor
#
# All fields except 'name' are optional. Cartographoor is the source of truth,
# and config.yaml values override cartographoor when explicitly set.
networks:
  # Example: Disable a cartographoor network
  # - name: sepolia
  #   enabled: false

  # Example: Override URL and metadata for a cartographoor network
  # - name: mainnet
  #   enabled: true
  #   target_url: "https://my-custom-cbt.example.com/api/v1"
  #   display_name: "Ethereum Mainnet"
  #   chain_id: 1
  #   genesis_time: 1606824023
  #   genesis_delay: 0

  # Example: Add a custom network not in cartographoor
  # - name: my-local-devnet
  #   enabled: true
  #   target_url: "http://localhost:8080/api/v1"
  #   display_name: "My Local Devnet"
  #   chain_id: 32382
  #   genesis_time: 1234567890
  #   genesis_delay: 10

  # Note: Networks from cartographoor are automatically added with all metadata.
  # Only add entries here to disable, override, or add custom networks.

# Experiment feature flags
# Controls which experiments are available per network
# By default, experiments are enabled for all networks unless overridden
experiments:
  live-slots:
    enabled: true
    networks: ["mainnet"]  # Only enabled for mainnet

  block-production:
    enabled: false         # Disabled for all networks

  attestation-performance:
    enabled: true          # Enabled for all networks (no networks specified = default)
